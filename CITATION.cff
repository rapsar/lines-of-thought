  Large Language Models achieve next-token prediction by
  transporting a vectorized piece of text (prompt) across an
  accompanying embedding space under the action of
  successive transformer layers. The resulting
  high-dimensional trajectories realize different
  contextualization, or 'thinking', steps, and fully
  determine the output probability distribution. We aim to
  characterize the statistical properties of ensembles of
  these 'lines of thought.'
